For the middle class, the king granted Charters, made a uniform law, started banking, offered protection, and expanded territory. In return, the middle class payed taxes to the king. While this money economy grew, the feudal lords were put into an economic squeeze. As one may see, that didn’t leave much of a place for the nobles, who were rapidly losing power.

Events like the Babylonian Captivity and the Great Schism further weakened the Church’s influence over the people. Aside from that, people were disgusted at the actions of the corrupt church officials. They would charge the people money for all church services, and they also allowed church positions to be bought. The princely lifestyle of the clergy further eroded regard for the church. While some still believed that religion held all the answers, others were beginning to put faith into reason and science. The uncertainty of the existence of God made people question the Church. Perhaps one of the most vital blows to the Church was the printing of the Bible in the vernacular language. That was a revolutionary act because only the clergy was permitted to interpret God’s words in the Bible. People angrily criticized the Church for that. A religious reformer, Jan Hus, led the Czechs who produced religious pamphlets and copies of the Bible in Czech and criticized the corruption of the leading Church officials.
