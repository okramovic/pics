For example, spatial skills decline steadily by a small amount each year from the age of 19 into old age – previous research had suggested they don’t start falling off until middle age. Men are on average a little better than women at navigating – though this could be entirely due to cultural biases (women are led to believe they are worse) and early life experiences (girls are rarely encouraged to be explorers), rather than biology as is commonly understood.

Anxiety and emotional instability (neuroticism) you could do without. If you are animated, self-disciplined, adventurous and confident, you are far less likely to get lost than if you are reserved, scatterbrained, closed-minded and phobic.

Another consideration is that personality is not the only driver of behaviour. Much depends on context: who I am with, what my emotional state is, where I happen to be. People who seem self-possessed in familiar places can be overwrought when facing the unknown. When we’re navigating, many things can affect our performance, some of which – working memory, spatial aware­ness, map-reading skills and so on – are easily improved. This means that you can be introverted and still be a good navigator, or conscientious and still be a poor one. Anxiety is the wayfinder’s greatest enemy, but the more you do it, the better you’ll get and the more confident you’ll become.
